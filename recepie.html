    <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 Longganisa Macau</li>
    <li>3 Slices of Sweet Ham</li>
    <li>5 Eggs</li>
    <li>1 Medium Carrot</li>
    <li>1 Large White Onion</li>
    <li>8 Cloves of Garlic</li>
    <li>3 Cups of Cooked Rice (Make sure it is a day old and has no more moisture left)</li> 
    <li>5 Pieces of Crab Sticks</li>
    <li>Knorr Liquid seasoning</li>
    <li>Spring Onion/Scallion</li>
</ul>   
    <h3><b>Cooking Procedure</b></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Dice the longganisa Macau, sweet ham, carrot, and crab sticks into small cubes. Finely chop the large white onion, and mince the garlic cloves. Finely chop the spring onion/scallion.</li>
    <li>In a large wok or frying pan, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. Add the diced longganisa Macau and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove the longganisa from the pan and set aside. In the same pan, add the diced sweet ham and cook until lightly browned. Remove and set aside with the longganisa.</li>
    <li>In the same pan, add a little more oil if necessary. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until they are translucent and soft. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it.</li>
    <li>Add the diced carrots and crab sticks to the pan. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the carrots are tender.</li>
    <li>Add the day-old cooked rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps. Mix thoroughly with the vegetables and meats. Add a splash of Knorr liquid seasoning and stir well to ensure everything is evenly coated. Cook for a few more minutes until everything is heated through. Remove the fried rice mixture from the pan and set aside.</li>
    <li>Clean the wok or frying pan if necessary, and heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl, beat them lightly, and pour them into the pan. Cook the eggs, stirring gently, until they are about 85% done.</li>
    <li>Add the fried rice mixture back into the pan with the eggs. Stir thoroughly to combine everything, making sure the eggs are fully cooked and evenly distributed throughout the rice</li>
    <li>Once everything is well mixed and heated through, sprinkle the finely chopped spring onion/scallion over the top. Give it a final stir, and the fried rice is ready to served and enjoyed.</li>
